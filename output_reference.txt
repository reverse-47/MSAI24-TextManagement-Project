Review: coffee coffee coffee!  I really don't do sweets for breakfast but i do like Dunkin Doughnut's coffee and you won't pay $4 for it!

Review: Delicious coffee here. Each day there is a different fresh roasted coffee. I like iced coffee and Tin Cup has a cold brew coffee which was so yummy. This isn't a "Starbucks" with 1000 coffee choices. If you want delicious coffee, iced or hot go to Tin Cup.

Review: My husband and I stopped by this coffee shop before heading out of town. It was hard to find a open parking spot. We didn't have to wait long for our coffee. We loved the coffee shop vibe. They didn't have many flavor options to choose from for coffee. My coffee wasn't a very bold taste like I prefer. I only drink my coffee with cream because I love the creamy rich coffee taste. This coffee tasted a little watered down. If you want a stronger brew coffee I would recommend getting something different.

Review: I got coffee, I don't like the taste of coffee, so yeah, it tastes like coffee... You might like it, ya know, if you like coffee.

Review: ZolliKoffee is the coffeeshop inside Jackelope Brewing. It's tiny - just the coffee bar itself, but you can sit in the brewery with your coffee. It's not a bad place to enjoy a coffee, but I wouldn't get a coffee here unless I was at Jackelope anyway getting a beer. Because who wants to enjoy just a coffee at a brewery? And, let's be honest, who wants to park at Jackelope just for a coffee? But the coffee's not bad.
